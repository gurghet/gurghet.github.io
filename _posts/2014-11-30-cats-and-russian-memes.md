# Cats are important! #

In our western culture famous cartoons cats are characters like Tom in “Tom & Jerry” and not much else really. How comes? Cats are important! The internet is probably more than 75% cats. Lolcats, demotivational cats, meme cats, grumpy cat and so on. It’s peculiar that American animation industries brought us so few.

![Cat that looks like Stalin][catStalin] Luckily it doesn’t take much time traveling and it turns out that Stalin was overwhelmed with kitties, yes, he was literally loaded with kitties! So for some strange reason, one of the most popular character in sovietic cartoons was the overly cute, big headed, round eyed pussy.

![Woof the cat][gav] I’d say the prince (or princess who knows) of all cartoon cats is without any doubt “Катёнок по имена Гав” wich means roughly “Woof the Cat”. If that isn’t enough to make you divide by zero from the irony take a peak at the subtle non-sense humor of the cartoon.

![Woof is being asked][woof2] Well Woof, what *are* you doing up there?
![Woof is actually being scared][woof3] Storms can be scary for cats.
![Sharik asks if he can join][woof4] Seems legit.

Woof the cat it’s probably one of the most popular character but there is another one so much popular that it’s on every milk bottle. It’s the Matroskin cat. In my personal opinion the milk is the best you can find in the stores, but in the cartoon poor hygene milking the cow makes the owner sick. Here is a snippet of the first episode, when the father stands for keeping the cat in the family, his wife not so much.

![Wife says: well you have to choose either me or the cat][pros1] Well, that’s just as good as saying that the cat has to go.
![Dad looks closely at the cat][pros2] Wait, is he seriously taking time to decide?
![Dad looks closely at wife][pros3] Ok, I know where this is going.

These are just two examples but you will find a huge amount of cat if you just do a search for Союзмультфильм whis is the major cartoon house in Russia. There you have my last one:

![Cat asks how to grow fast][cot1] “How big you are Mr. Mushroom, how did you get big so fast?”
![Mushroom answer that the rain makes everything grow faster][cot2] “The rain makes everything grow faster!”
![Cat all wet][cot3] “Have I grown up yet”
